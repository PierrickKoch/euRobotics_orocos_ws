OROCOS demo application - euRobotics Forum April 7th, 2011

This stack contains 3 OROCOS components:
- extendedKalmanFilterComponentRobot: estimates the 2D pose (x,y,theta) of the
  YouBot based on laser scans measuring the distance to a wall
- youbot_simulator: simulates the YouBot motion and generates distance measurements
- youbot_controller: generates control commands to steer the YouBot to the
  desired pose
